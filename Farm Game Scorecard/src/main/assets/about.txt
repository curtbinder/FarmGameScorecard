<h1>Farm Game Scorecard</h1>
<p>The Farm Game Scorecard is designed to help score your Farm Game. It totals up your value from
the board game "The Farming Game." You enter in your values and it computes your score for you.
It allows for up to 6 players to be tracked (the same as the board game). It also keeps a history
of your game scores so you can look back on previous games.
